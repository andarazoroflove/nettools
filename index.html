script to ping things...</font></i></p>
<p>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFFCC">
current version:&nbsp; 2.0.1 (08.22.2006)</span></p><hr>
<p><u><b><font face="Courier New">NEWS</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">As of version 1.7, nettools no longer requires 
CHOICE.EXE. CHOICE will still be available below, its quite useful. There is no 
compiled .exe of
<a href="http://nettools.andarazoroflove.org/archive/nettools1.7.bat">
<span style="text-decoration: none">version 1.7</span></a> available--however 
I've left it available because it marks the end of use for CHOICE. As of version 
1.7 the script now requires the Windows Scripting Host to accept variables. Why? 
Because nettools had a critical flaw: it was allowing redirected (|) commands 
because it was providing command line access (albeit restricted). If you trust 
your users I'd suggest continue to use
<a href="http://nettools.andarazoroflove.org/archive/nettools1.6.exe">
<span style="text-decoration: none">version 1.6</span></a> as its faster and 
doesn't need WSH.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">Nettools now uses a
<a href="http://nettools.andarazoroflove.org/archive/nettools.vbs">
<span style="text-decoration: none">stub of Windows Scripting</span></a> and the 
command-line processor cscript (included since Win98) to accept the input 
variable and parse it in to a file which is manipulated by nettools in the 
background. Nettools processes the file with a .com object written in assembler 
on the fly during script initialization. This .com object (<a href="http://nettools.andarazoroflove.org/archive/create.pipecleaner.bat"><span style="text-decoration: none">pipeclean.com</span></a>) 
actively searches the file for the | and returns an ILLEGAL SYNTAX error which 
prevents the user from spawning unwanted processes. Nettools creates the .vbs 
and .com object on the fly and deletes them as soon as the command finishes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">I have created a step-by-step guide to compiling 
nettools using the free, built-in-to-windows program called IExpress (Don't 
worry the IE doesn't stand for Internet Explorer, it stands for 
Installation-Extractor). View the guide

<p><u><b><font face="Courier New">FAQ</font></b></u></p>
<p><b><font face="Courier New">Does the world really need another network 
utility?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">Sure, why not? I manage about 500 Windows XP 
workstations for a call-center company who's client has recently decided to 
foray in to the WiFi Internet Service Provider business. The call-center agent's 
needed a teaching tool which would mimic the standard DOS/CMD commands and responses for 
troubleshooting tools like <b>PING, TRACERT, </b>and <b>NSLOOKUP</b>. </font>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Courier New">Why wouldn't a freeware utility like <i>PingIt!</i> 
or <i>TraceIt!</i> work?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">Well there in lies the quandary. Those are great 
examples of freeware utilities to do just that, but if you only have access to 
DOS/CMD (there's lots o'Win98 users still out there) then you don't have those 
utilities. Besides, if you need to use these tools for troubleshooting, you 
won't be able to download them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New"><b>nettools</b> is the solution to a unique 
instructional design problem, &quot;<i>how do we train agents to use these DOS tools 
with out providing them access to the command line?</i>&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New"><b>nettools</b> is a simple script which will allow 
the user to use PING, TRACERT, NSLOOKUP and NETSH commands while mimicking the 
DOS/CMD environment found in all 32/64bit versions of Windows<sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps">(R)</span></sup>. 
Through a simple menu interface the user can interact with these TCP/IP commands 
becoming familiar with the syntax of each command. Because nettools looks and 
acts just like the command line (because it is, really) the user gets real 
experience. </font></p>
